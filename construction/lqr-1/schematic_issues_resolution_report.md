## Schematic Issues Resolution Report
### LQG FTL Vessel - LQR-1 System Schematics

**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ RESOLVED - Overlapping Labels (VC1 overlaps MC1)
**Problem:** VC1 and MC1 components were positioned too close, causing label overlap
**Solution:** 
- Increased component separation to 15+ units
- Positioned MC1 coils at (-15, 0) and (15, 0) 
- Moved VC1 labels below reactor to dedicated area
- Used separate label elements for multi-line text

**Result:** Clear separation between all components with no overlaps

#### 2. ✅ RESOLVED - "\n" Renders as Text Instead of Newlines
**Problem:** Single labels with `\n` characters displayed literally instead of line breaks
**Solution:**
- Replaced single labels with multiple separate `elm.Label()` elements
- Used `drawing.add()` for each line of text
- Removed all `\n` characters from label strings

**Result:** Proper line breaks with readable multi-line text

#### 3. ✅ RESOLVED - Missing Electrical Connection Lines
**Problem:** No electrical connections shown between components
**Solution:**
- Added connection lines between MC1 coils and reactor
- Added connection line between MC2 coils and reactor
- Added labeled connections for "Toroidal Field" and "Poloidal Field"
- Added power output connections with proper routing

**Result:** Complete electrical schematic with all connections visible

#### 4. ✅ RESOLVED - Component Obscuring (MC1-1 obscured by VC1)
**Problem:** Assembly layout had overlapping components
**Solution:**
- Repositioned MC1 coils to (-15, 5), (-15, 0), (-15, -5) and (15, 5), (15, 0), (15, -5)
- Moved VC2 segments to outer positions: (-10, 8), (0, 10), (10, 8)
- Positioned MC2 coils at safe distance: (-8, 12), (0, 14), (8, 12)
- Central VC1 chamber positioned at (0, 0) with 6x6 size

**Result:** All components clearly visible with no obscuring

#### 5. ✅ RESOLVED - All Square Symbols (Poor Symbol Choice)
**Problem:** All components used generic square rectangles
**Solution:**
- **VC1 Vacuum Chamber:** Large filled rectangle (6x6) - appropriate for pressure vessel
- **VC2 Tungsten Segments:** Small rectangles (2x1.5) - appropriate for structural segments
- **MC1 Toroidal Coils:** Double-layer rectangles (outer 3x2, inner 2x1.5) - simulates coil winding
- **MC2 Poloidal Coils:** Elongated rectangles (4x1.5) - appropriate for poloidal geometry
- **Support Systems:** Distinctive rectangular shapes with appropriate sizing

**Result:** Visually distinct symbols that represent actual component geometry

### Technical Improvements Implemented

#### Enhanced Configuration
- **Scaling:** `inches_per_unit=0.5` for system, `0.6` for assembly
- **Line Weight:** Reduced to 1.5 for cleaner appearance
- **Font Size:** Optimized to 10 for system, 9 for assembly layout
- **Spacing:** Used `elm.Gap().down(2)` for proper title spacing

#### Improved Positioning Strategy
- **System Schematic:** Radial layout with 15+ unit separation
- **Assembly Layout:** Grid-based positioning with no overlaps
- **Labels:** Separate positioning below/beside components
- **Connections:** Clear routing with labeled pathways

#### Symbol Differentiation
- **Colors:** Maintained distinct colors per component type
- **Shapes:** Varied rectangle sizes and layering
- **Positioning:** Strategic placement to show function
- **Labeling:** Clear identification with material specifications
