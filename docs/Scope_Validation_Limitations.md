# Scope, Validation & Limitations

This document summarizes the intended scope of artifacts in this repository, the validation performed on model outputs, and limitations researchers should be aware of.

- Research-stage artifacts: Code and numerical examples are intended for research, reproducibility, and peer review. They are not production-ready hardware specifications.
- Reproducibility: For any reported numeric result, consult the `docs/benchmarks/` directory for configuration files, random seeds, and scripts used to generate outputs.
- Uncertainty quantification: Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses accompany selected reports; where UQ is missing, treat performance numbers as preliminary.
- Safety and compliance: Any experimental or hardware work derived from these artifacts must undergo institutional safety review and comply with export/control regulations.

Contributors should include reproduction instructions and a small uncertainty note when adding performance figures.
