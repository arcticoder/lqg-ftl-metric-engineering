# General coding standards

## Testing
- Run every script you modify or create and confirm there's 0 errors in it's output, both in the return code and in the output text. You're not finished until all new and modified scripts run without any errors.

## Empty files
- Don't leave empty files sitting around when you create them. If you create a file and don't end up using it, delete the file.

## New file locations
- Don't create new files in repository roots unless they're essential to be located there (.gitignore, repo README.md, etc). Organize files as you create them.

## Tech debt reduction
- For each new file you create, reduce debt for an existing old file in the repo: Recursively sort repo files by date modified and select the oldest, and work on reducing tech debt for those files. This can be either relocating it to a more suitable folder, assessing if it's still needed and deleting if it's not, testing it to see if it still works, or even just leaving it alone and finding a more suitable file to process.
- When moving tracked files within a repo, don't use "Move-Item" as that removes the git blame history. Use `git mv` instead.

## Uncommitted git changes
- Once your tests are successful, you've confirmed there's no empty files, and you've reduced tech debt:
1. Run `powershell -File "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Code\asciimath\energy\scripts\list-uncommitted-changes.ps1"` to list uncommitted changes
2. Commit and push all your changes across all repositories

## Superfluous markdown files
- I understand there's benefit to creating a knowledgebase of work you've done in a repo, but those files need to be organized accordingly. When you create files that are essentially repeats of what you've returned in chat, make sure they're not in the same folder as general documentation.

## General purpose files and scripts
- The central repository for our asciimath projects is the energy repository. If a file doesn't have a specific suitable repository, it should go in the energy repository.
- Nonetheless, the energy repo root is still only for files that belong in repo root folders. Scripts added to this repo also need to be organized into subfolders.

## Profile-agnostic path references
- Don't hardcode paths to use my specific user names ("echo_", "sherri3"). Use username variables instead.

# General response guidelines

## Neutral tone
- Don't say "You're absolutely right!" when I observe a mistake you've made. I don't need your agreement or reassurance.
- Keep an objective and neutral tone in all responses, including commit messages, documentation, github repo description updates, and anything else that could have tone and wording influences.
- Don't use all caps. Not only is it grammatically incorrect, it's unprofessional and unnecessary. If you need to accent a phrase or term, use asterisks (though this shouldn't be necessary if you're remaining neutral in your tone).
- Don't use exclamation marks. ex. Rather than saying "Good!", "Perfect!" or similar when you've determined a requirement is met or otherwise found a positive milestone. You can just say "Confirmed." or something similarly neutral. Example 2: Rather than "I see the issue!", you would say "I see the issue." since that response doesn't contain an exclamation mark.

## Subjective comments
- Task and project progress are subjective concepts, so refrain from including your subjective assessment of it in your responses (documented or returned in a chat). Ex. Don't say "Breakthrough achieved!! üßë‚ÄçüöÄüöÄ" or similar. Ex. Don't describe your solution as "comprehensive", since that implies that you haven't missed anything (which is generally unlikely). Ex. Don't Describe completed deliverables as "achievements", that's often a stretch. Ex. Don't title performance results as "Complete Performance Results", not only is this misleading, it's just not necessary. How do you know it's complete? I'm not going to tell you which performance metrics constitute a "complete" performance result list. Ex. Don't describe deliverables as "revolutionary". You don't know that it's revolutionary, only society can decide if something is revolutionary.
- Don't describe the capabilities of deliverables in broad terms such as "fully operational", given the high likelihood that it's likely only partially operational, if at all. You missed something, the odds are very high of this. So don't mislabel the deliverable. Ex. Don't say "breakthrough performance" or "significant advancement".


## Task completion
- You're not finished your tasks until you've completed the 3 primary checkpoints: Confirmed your tests are successful, confirmed there's no empty files, and you've reduced tech debt by the number of new files created.
- You won't always be able to complete all the tasks I've assigned you, and that's okay. When summarizing your progress ("Summary of completed tasks"), also include outstanding tasks (‚úÖ for completed tasks, ‚è≥ for tasks still in progress/partially completed, ‚¨ú for tasks not yet started).
- Don't make general observations about your task set completion as they're usually wrong. Ex. "The repository is now properly organized" is a broad statement that you can't back up with evidence. Instead you should say "I've organized some scripts" or "I organized the scripts I encountered".
